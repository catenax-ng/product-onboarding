# How to release a Helm chart

This guide will describe, why you should release your Helm charts and how you can achieve that. We will also describe
some common pitfalls and how to handle them.

If the team has requested a new repository based on
the [k8s-helm-example](https://github.com/catenax-ng/k8s-Helm-example) template repository,
the [chart releaser action](#adding-the-chart-release-github-workflow) will be part of it. The file can be
modified/personalized to specific needs.

## Why should you release your Helm chart?

There are two main reasons, why we want to release Helm charts in the Catena-X context.

1. Testing
2. Releasing

First, your application may have dependencies (i.e. via API call). If you want to test the integration between your app
and the app you are depending on, you need a well working version of the app. Best case, you can do that on your own.
This is a very easy task if the app you are depending on is available as released Helm chart. This way you can easily
add it as dependency to your own deployment.

The second aspect is the overall integration and end-to-end test for Catena-X. A reliable end-to-end test of Catena-X
components needs a reproducible set of applications in specific versions, with known configuration and test data. We
achieve that, by specifying all necessary components for a test run as dependency in an umbrella Helm chart.
Prerequisite for adding a product application as dependency, the corresponding Helm chart needs to be released and
publicly available.

After passing the end-to-end testing, a specific set of applications in their tested versions can be released. This
means, we will provide some kind of installer, that is capable of installing all the previously tested applications
after they have been quality assured. This installer will be provided as an umbrella Helm chart as well. This chart can
be used by anyone, who wants to deploy and host Catena-X applications.

## How can you release your Helm chart?

There are several options to release your chart. We recommend to use the
[chart-releaser-action](https://github.com/helm/chart-releaser-action) in a GitHub workflow. For `chart-releaser-action`
to work, the repo needs to meet some requirements:

### Prerequisites

We recommend using `chart-releaser-action` in its default configuration. There are three requirements that have to be
met, if you want to use the default configuration.

1. Your Helm charts need to be in the `/charts/<chart-name>` directory of your repository
2. GitHub pages need to be activated for your repository and point to _gh-pages_ branch. Your GitHub organization admins
   can activate that for you
3. The _gh-pages_ branch needs to exist on the remote repository on GitHub

### Adding the chart release GitHub workflow

As mentioned before, releasing the chart can be done via GitHub workflow. Below, you can find an example workflow that
uses the `chart-releaser-action` to package and publish your charts. You can use this example in your own repository
without changes.

The workflow will release your Helm chart in your repository (creating a GitHub release).

This workflow can be triggered manually via GitHub action UI or will automatically be triggered on pushing into the main
branch of your repository.

Step ___Update Helm dependencies for chartX___ needs to be included for every chart in the repository that has
dependencies in their _Chart.yaml_ file!

```yaml
      - name: Update Helm dependencies for chartX
        run: |
          cd charts/chartX
          helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami
          helm dependency update
```

Explanation:

- `cd charts/<chart-name>` : Change the working directory to the directory where the _Chart.yaml_ is located
- `helm repo add` : add the external repository for every dependency that is in the _Chart.yaml_ file
- `helm dependency update` : can run as it is

:::

```yaml
name: Release Charts

on:
  push:
    # prevent unnecessary GH action runs for files outside of charts folder
    paths:
      - 'charts/**'
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  release:
    # depending on default permission settings for your org (contents being read-only or read-write for workloads), you will have to add permissions
    # see: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/automatic-token-authentication#modifying-the-permissions-for-the-github_token
    permissions:
      contents: write
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0

      - name: Configure Git
        run: |
          git config user.name "$GITHUB_ACTOR"
          git config user.email "$GITHUB_ACTOR@users.noreply.github.com"

      - name: Install Helm
        uses: azure/setup-helm@v3
        with:
          token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}

      # OPTIONAL, SEE NOTE ABOVE!!
      - name: Update helm dependencies for chart1
        run: |
          cd charts/chart1
          helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami
          helm dependency update

      # OPTIONAL, SEE NOTE ABOVE!!
      - name: Update helm dependencies for chart2
        run: |
          cd charts/chart2
          helm repo add azure-marketplace https://marketplace.azurecr.io/helm/v1/repo
          helm dependency update

      - name: Run chart-releaser
        uses: helm/chart-releaser-action@v1.4.1
        env:
          CR_TOKEN: "${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}"

```

### How to run the release action

If you are using the chart release workflow 'as-is' from above, it will be triggered automatically on every push that
contains changes in the `charts` directory.

The chart-releaser-action will check your charts directory for the following changes (changed values, changed templates,
changed dependencies, etc.) and if there are changes, package the chart into a compressed archive. Additionally, it will
update the `index.yaml` file in the 'gh-pages' branch. This index.yaml file is needed, for enabling your GitHub pages
to function as repository for the released Helm chart.

## Preparing your Helm chart for release

While you can release your Helm chart 'as is', there are some details to pay attention to regarding the structure and
values of your chart:

### Add 'enabled' flags to optional services and resources

If your application contains optional steps, like an initial data set that is created via init container, it is best to
wrap this declaration with an if statement, so that a user of your Helm chart can decide to not add this declaration to
his cluster. The ingress definition(s) is also a good candidate for this.

Such an if statement could look like the following:

```gotemplate
# ingress.yaml
{{ if .Values.ingress.enabled }}
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
...
{{ end }}
```

To enable/disable the ingress definition, you can define it in this way in your values.yaml

```yaml
# values.yaml
...
ingress:
  enabled: false # true, if you want to specify ingress definitions
...
```

### Do not specify ingress URLs

If your application include ingress definitions, you should not include any URL/host declarations in your
`values.yaml`. The default file will always be used to configure your deployment. If you release your Helm chart
including a specific domain will be applied on every infrastructure as well. Regardless of their completely different
domain setup.

It is best practice to not add any ingress related configuration at all in your default `values.yaml`. Instead, just
define what a user of your Helm chart can configure through empty values, like in the following example:

```yaml
# values.yaml
ingress:
  enabled: false
  className: ""
  annotations: { }
  hosts: [ ]
  tls: [ ]
```

For deployments to your own infrastructure, you can still configure your ingress through an environment
specific `values-<env>.yaml`.
